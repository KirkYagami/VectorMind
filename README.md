# **VectorMind** 🚀  
**100% Locally Running AI-Powered Knowledge Retrieval System**  

## 🌟 **Overview**  
VectorMind is a fully open-source, AI-powered knowledge retrieval system that leverages state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs. It allows users to build their own vectorized knowledge bases by uploading documents or scraping websites and then querying them using advanced AI models.  

## 🔧 **Key Features**  
✅ **Open-Source AI Stack** – Uses [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) for local LLM inference, [Nomic Embed Text](https://nomic.ai/) for embeddings, and [ChromaDB](https://chromadb.com/) for vector storage.  
✅ **Multi-Format Support** – Upload and process PDFs, DOCX, and TXT files.  
✅ **Web Scraping** – Extracts content from websites, including Wikipedia.  
✅ **Efficient Vector Search** – Stores and retrieves relevant knowledge efficiently.  
✅ **Flexible UI** – Provides both Gradio and Streamlit interfaces for ease of use.  

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**  
- **Vector Database:** ChromaDB  
- **Embeddings:** Nomic Embed Text  
- **LLM Inference:** LLaMa3.2 via Ollama  
- **Text Processing:** LangChain  
- **Frontend:** Gradio, Streamlit  
- **Web Scraping:** BeautifulSoup  

## 🚀 **How It Works**  
1️⃣ Upload documents or provide a website URL  
2️⃣ Convert text into embeddings using Nomic Embed Text  
3️⃣ Store vectorized data in ChromaDB  
4️⃣ Query the knowledge base and retrieve AI-powered answers
